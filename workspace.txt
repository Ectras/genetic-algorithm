* Genes?
  * [v] Store best_genes on Genotype, copy genes on storing best chromosome (solve M+2 issue)
  * [v] Change Chromosome<Genotype> to Genotype::Chromosome
  * [v] Change Population<Genotype> to Population<Chromosome>
  * [v] Check fitness API
  * [x] REJECTED: External genes are always Vec<Allele> (seed and best_genes). Internal genes can be anything
  * [v] Alway use best_genes as result. Remove best_chromosome
  * [v] Store best chromosome separately in StaticMatrixGenotype (as [T; N]), so population == M?
  * [v] generate best chromosome again from best_genes and genotype?, possible if OwnsGenes
  * [v] reduce number of Chromosome types (multi is same as single, static and dynamic are same as well)
  * [v] Remove empty chromomsome concept, just use Options again in the code (much cleaner)
  * [v] Add best_genes_and_fitness_score tuple method on Strategy
  * [v] Rename OwnesGenes to OwnsGenes
  * [v] Add IncrementalGenotype to MatrixGenotypes
  * [v] Add chromosomes manager logic to HillClimb
  * [v] rename chromosome_constructor to chromosome_constructor_random
  * [v] Use mutation_type for IncrementalGenotype logic in Range/ MultiRange / Dynamic/ Static
  * [v] Move some shared logic back to ChromosomeManager
  * [v] Populate neighbours in existing population.chromosomes vec
  * [v] Rename fill_neighbouring_population to fill_neighbouring_chromosomes or add true population to fill
  * [v] Drop mutability from genotype in Fitness
  * [v] drop StochasticSecondary and SteepestAscentSecondary
  * [v] Reconsider OwnsGenes and RefersGenes naming
  * [ ] Enable chromosome_recycling always, and remove checks
  * [ ] Move logic of random gene factory inside set_random_genes
  * [ ] Fix Reporting
  * [ ] document Fitness impl levels very extensively
  * [ ] neigbouring better garantees? Can max stale gen be 1? Check, also check use of ugly loop. Precision really matters here, may be set it?
  * [ ] Note on GPU in performance section
  * [ ] Remove action CopyAndDrop

* Store staticMatrixGenotype on heap using Box?
* Extensions benchmark is noisy
* Distinction between poplation, offspring, parent cardinality (as offspring is always freshly mutated, generating cardinality, while the parents could all be equal)
* Chunk parallel iters for less switching?
* Document GenotypeBuilder, Split for Range types?
