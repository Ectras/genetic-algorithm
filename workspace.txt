* [ ] StrategyBuilder
      * with_par_fitness_threshold
      * with_par_fitness_min_length
      * with_permutate_threshold?
      * with_hill_climb_variant?
* [ ] Remove max_scale_index on state, it is on Genotype, just take it there. Also implement mutation type for all genotypes, to scaled can trigger current_scale_index initialization
* [ ] implement MutationType::Random for neighbouring chromosomes?
* [ ] reuse TryFromStrategyBuilderError

* [ ] Add valid and target fitness score to Permutate? Seems illogical, but would be symmetrical. Don't know yet
* [ ] neigbouring better garantees? Can max stale gen be 1 (maybe is equal_fitness is false)? Check
* [ ] Move logic out of random gene factory inside set_random_genes
* [ ] Document GenotypeBuilder, Split for Range types?
