why is dedup 30% faster, the iterator is unsorted, so dedup does almost nothing.

            rng.sample_iter(self.gene_index_sampler)
                .take(number_of_crossovers)
                .dedup()
                .for_each(|index| {
                    std::mem::swap(&mut father.genes[index], &mut mother.genes[index]);
                });

I don't feel comfortable adding dedup because it works as the underlying reason is non-transparant and can change
