Rename Compete to Select?
Add selection-rate to Compete

Add MatrixGenotype which stores a population x genes_size matrix and keeps the genes internal. CHromosome just references the ID using reference-id. Population can be sorted etc. verylightly as the Chromosome is just a light pointer.
use nalgebra (2D). Make sure to allow a dealloc call for chromosomes which are dropped from the population

Maybe use TinyVector for Population? (it us usually less than 1000 anyway)
