Add on_equal_fitness to Evolve as well?
still counts as stale generations

[HillClimbVariant::Stochastic]:
  with_scaling: 
    move only on edges of scale
    scale down after max_stale_generations
    stop if max_stale_generations reached at smallest scale
  without_scaling: 
    mutate uniformly over range (neighbour_range or allele_range fallback)
    stop if max_stale_generations reached
  with_on_equal_fitness:
    high max_stale_generations
  without_on_equal_fitness:
    high max_stale_generations

[HillClimbVariant::SteepestAscent]:
  with_scaling: 
    move only on edges of scale
    scale down after max_stale_generations
    stop if max_stale_generations reached at smallest scale
  without_scaling: 
    mutate uniformly over range (neighbour_range or allele_range fallback), ensure lower and higher neighbour
    stop if max_stale_generations reached
  with_on_equal_fitness:
    high max_stale_generations
  without_on_equal_fitness:
    no max_stale_generations, by definition 1
