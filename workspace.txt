right so the issue here is that the contract the Gene trait expresses, is that a type implementing it must be able to be mutated by any caller-chosen type T: Gene
You cannot choose which one
so BinaryGene cannot satisfy that contract if it can only be mutated by BinaryGenes only
You may want to change the definition of the gene trait instead, to express that mutate can only be called with a single type T chosen by the implementor instead, e.g.

trait Gene<T: Gene> {
    fn mutate(&mut self, _: &[T], …)
}

that way you can correctly express

impl Gene<BinaryGene> for BinaryGene {
    fn mutate(&mut self, _gene_values: &[BinaryGene], …) { … }
}

and depending on whether your gene types can be mutated by a single or  possibly multiple other gene types, then you may want T to be an "associated type" of Gene instead:

trait Gene {
    type T: Gene;
    fn mutate(&mut self, _: &[Self::T], …);
}

or maybe even your gene types will only be able to be mutated by values of that same gene type, in which case you could get rid of T altogether:

trait Gene {
    fn mutate(&mut self, _: &[Self], …);
}
